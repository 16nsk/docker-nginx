# docker-nginx
Nginx compiled with a few addons

I've made this image as I wanted the latest STABLE version of Nginx and
also some modules from Github that I find useful.

Also it's on Centos based.

TODO:
  - Remove any module that is not needed

Compile options
  -

Addons:
  - [Nginx virtual host traffic status module](https://github.com/vozlt/nginx-module-vts)


Truly,
M.
